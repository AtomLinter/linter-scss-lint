This linter plugin for [Linter](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter) provides an interface to [scss-lint](https://github.com/causes/scss-lint). It will be used with files that have the “SCSS” syntax.

### Installation
Linter package must be installed in order to use this plugin. If Linter is not installed, please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter).

#### scss-lint installation
Before using this plugin, you must ensure that `scss-lint` is installed on your system. To install `scss-lint`, do the following:

1. Install [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/).

2. Install [scss-lint](https://github.com/causes/scss-lint) by typing the following in a terminal:
   ```
   gem install scss_lint
   ```

Now you can proceed to install the linter-scss-lint plugin.

#### Plugin installation
```
$ apm install linter-scss-lint
```

### Settings
You can configure linter-scss-lint by editing ~/.atom/config.cson (choose Open Your Config in Atom menu):
```cson
'linter-scss-lint':

  # Optionally specify additional arguments to be passed to `scss-lint`.
  # Run `scss-lint -h` to see available options.
  'additionalArguments': null

  # The `scss-lint` path. Run `which scss-lint` to find this path.
  'executablePath': null
```

### Config file
Linter will start looking for `.scss-lint.yml` file in the same directory as the file that's being linted. If not found, it will move one level up the directory tree all the way up to the filesystem root.
